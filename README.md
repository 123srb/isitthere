This was just a quick script to solve a problem.  This code takes a picture with a webcam, finds the average color,
and then in the future takes another picture, averages the color, and compares the two to see if something has changed.


To get this working you'll need to change the directory it saves the image in in the capture_picture function, and the
email information in the SendMail function
